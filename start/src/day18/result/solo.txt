솔로
							제니
천진난만 청순가련
새침한 척 이젠 지쳐 나
귀찮아
매일 뭐 해? 어디야? 밥은? 잘 자
Baby 자기 여보 보고 싶어
다 부질없어
You got me like (oh, oh, oh)
이건 아무 감동 없는 love story
(Oh, oh, oh) 어떤 설렘도 어떤 의미도
(Oh, oh, oh) 네겐 미안하지만 I'm not sorry
(Oh, oh, oh) 오늘부터 난 난 난
빛이 나는 솔로
빛이 나는 솔로
I'm goin' solo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
I'm goin' solo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
Used to be your girl, but nevermind that used to
Let me shine, gettin' mine, I hit you with that ddu-ddu
Got a lot of whatever I want, like I could lose two
Wanna find me? I be in Paris a lot, that's beaucoup
Too cool, ooh, four-finger ring, pink on it
Chain all ice like I could pour this drink on it
Been gone and came back, comin' for the payback
Asked them how you like it and it's lookin' like they hate that
W, no L's, covered W and Elle, and it's none left on the shelf
Get in trouble by myself, solo, oh well
All me, cross seas, Coco Chanel
Palm trees, calm breeze, living in a dollhouse
I don't need a Ken, I can watch him walk out
Solo, but I got many I could thank
You could see it in my eyes, like every time I blink
